# Bitwise Operations in C
This program uses bitwise operations to embed and extract hidden bits within binary integer arrays.
The output displays each binary number of the array in decimal format, then replaces the least significant bits of the array elements with a byte byte0.
This byte0 is later retrieved by taking the least significant bits of the elements of the new array and recombining them to form byte0

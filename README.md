# Bitwise Operations in C
*This program uses bitwise operations to embed and extract hidden bits within binary integer arrays.
*The output displays each binary number of the array in decimal format, then replaces the least significant bits of the array elements with a byte byte0.
*This byte0 is later retrieved by taking the least significant bits of the elements of the new array and recombining them to form byte0
